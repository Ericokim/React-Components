                    Video technology was first developed for mechanical
                    television systems, which were quickly replaced by
                    cathode-ray tube (CRT) television systems, but several new
                    technologies for video display devices have since been
                    invented. Video was originally exclusively a live
                    technology.

                    An audio signal is a representation of sound, typically
                    using either a changing level of electrical voltage for
                    analog signals, or a series of binary numbers for digital
                    signals. Audio signals have frequencies in the audio
                    frequency range of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz, which
                    corresponds to the lower and upper limits of human hearing.

                    Advertising is a marketing communication that employs an
                    openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a
                    product, service or idea.[1]: 465  Sponsors of advertising
                    are typically businesses wishing to promote their products
                    or services. Advertising is differentiated from public
                    relations in that an advertiser pays for and has control
                    over the message.

                    A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized
                    representation of thought, often the manifestation of
                    non-fictional, as well as fictional, content. The word
                    originates from the Latin Documentum, which denotes a
                    "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceō denotes "to teach".

                    In literary theory, a text is any object that can be "read",
                    whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign,
                    an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of
                    clothing. It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some
                    kind of informative message.
